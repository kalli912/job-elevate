# Job Elevate —  An AI-Powered Job Matching & Upskilling Platform
## Description 
 This project is a web application that allos users to create accounts, login, and apply for jobs

A full-stack Django web application that connects job seekers with career opportunities using **Machine Learning**, **AI-generated assessments**, and **personalized learning paths**. Built as an academic project demonstrating end-to-end ML integration in a production-style web app.

## ML Model — Job-Candidate Fit Predictor

### What It Does
Predicts how well a **job seeker** matches a **job posting** using a trained **Random Forest Classifier** (ensemble of 200 decision trees).

- **Input:** A (User, Job) pair
- **Output:** Fit probability score (0.0 – 1.0)
- **Integration:** Used in recruiter's candidate ranking and job recommendation engine

### How It Works

```

```

### 23 Features Extracted

| Category | Features | Count |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Skill Match | match ratio, matched count, required count, missing mandatory, avg/min proficiency, proficiency gap, max gap, overconfidence | 9 |
| Experience | experience delta, experience ratio, meets requirement | 3 |
| Education | education level (ordinal), CGPA (normalized) | 2 |
| Profile Richness | projects, certifications, internships, work experience, completeness | 5 |
| Assessment | pass rate, avg score, verified skill count | 3 |
| Text Similarity | TF-IDF cosine similarity (user profile vs job description) | 1 |

### Training Pipeline

```bash
# Step 1: Seed demo data (10 users, 8 jobs, 22 applications)
python manage.py seed_demo_data

# Step 2: Train the Random Forest model
python manage.py train_fit_model --synthetic 2000

# Step 3: Evaluate and generate presentable report
python manage.py evaluate_model
```

- **Validation:** 5-fold Stratified Cross-Validation
- **Train/Test Split:** 80%/20% with stratification
- **Class Balancing:** Handled via `class_weight='balanced'`
- **Saved Artifacts:** `ml/saved_models/` (model .joblib, scaler .joblib, report .json, evaluation .txt)

### ML Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `ml/feature_engineering.py` | Extracts 23 features from (User, Job) pairs |
| `ml/dataset.py` | Builds training data from real applications + synthetic generation |
| `ml/trainer.py` | Trains Random Forest, 5-fold CV, saves model |
| `ml/predictor.py` | Thread-safe singleton for serving predictions at runtime |
| `ml/management/commands/train_fit_model.py` | Django command to train the model |
| `ml/management/commands/evaluate_model.py` | Django command to generate evaluation report |
| `ml/management/commands/seed_demo_data.py` | Seed realistic demo data for training |
| `ml/saved_models/` | Trained model, scaler, and reports |

## Key Features

### AI-Powered Job Recommendations
- **Content-based filtering** using Jaccard skill similarity (40%) + coverage score (60%)
- **ML boost**: Random Forest fit score blended at 15% weight into recommendations
- Located in `jobs/recommendation_engine.py`

### Skill Assessment System (Anti-Cheating)
- 20 MCQ questions per assessment: 8 Easy + 6 Medium + 6 Hard
- Questions generated ONCE per skill via Google Gemini API, cached in `QuestionBank`
- **Anti-cheating measures:**
  - Correct answers stored as TEXT values, not option indices
  - Answer options shuffled per user via `shuffle_seed`
  - Unique question selection per attempt via `selected_question_ids`
- Passing threshold: 60% (12/20 correct)
- Proficiency scores on 0-10 scale

### Resume Builder
- ATS-compliant resume generation from user profile data
- PDF export via ReportLab/WeasyPrint
- Multiple template options

### AI Learning Paths
- Google Gemini generates personalized course recommendations
- Based on skill gaps identified through assessments
- Fallback to template recommendations if API unavailable

### Multi-Agent AI System
- **Career Agent**: Personalized career guidance for job seekers
- **Recruiter Agent**: AI assistant for recruiter workflows
- Circuit breaker pattern for API reliability

### Recruiter Dashboard
- Post jobs with skill requirements and proficiency levels (1-10 scale)
- View ranked candidates with ML-powered fit scores
- Application status management (Applied → Shortlisted → Interview → Offered → Hired / Rejected)
